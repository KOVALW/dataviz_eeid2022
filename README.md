AKA daza viz

Ideas so far:
We are building comm tools for risk assessment

Categories:
Mapping, 
contours of risk for independent risk factors,

We want to find the best way to show assessment for different denominators of risk

E.g. individuals infected, area affected, productivity increases/decreases

We also want to put together a collection of dataviz resources/literature
